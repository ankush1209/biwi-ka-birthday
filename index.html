      <div class="photo-card fade-slide delay-1"><img src="photo1.JPG" alt="Her" /><p>Some days, when I’m not around you, I try to write down what I feel. It’s never enough. No sentence captures what your laugh does to my heart. No word feels big enough to hold your kindness. But today, I’ll try anyway: I love you, endlessly and in all the little and loud ways.🕊️</p></div>
      <div class="photo-card fade-slide delay-2"><img src="photo2.JPG" alt="Us" /><p>You look like what my happiness looks like 💞</p></div>
      <div class="photo-card fade-slide delay-3"><img src="photo4.JPG" alt="Fun" /><p>Biwi, I’ve watched you grow, laugh, cry, and shine — and I swear, every version of you is beautiful.
27 isn’t just a number. It’s a chapter. And I can’t wait to write it with you — full of messy breakfasts, deep talks at 1am, travel misadventures, and silent moments that feel like home. 🏡✨
Happy birthday to the love of my life. Thank you for being you. Always. 💜</p></div>
      <div class="photo-card fade-slide delay-4"><img src="photo3.JPG" alt="Memories" /><p>27? Damn, you’re aging like fine wine and I’m just here getting tipsy on your vibe. 🍷🔥
Birthday smooches incoming… but only after cake! 🍰😉
Love you, drama queen 👑💋</p></div>
      <div class="photo-card fade-slide delay-5"><img src="photo5.JPG" alt="Cute" /><p>You mean the world to me, and I’m so lucky to share this life with you. Let’s create more memories, laugh more, and love endlessly💋.</p></div>

      <p>Happy 27th Birthday! 💖<br>You know what’s dangerously attractive?<br>
A girl who turns a year hotter and still manages to drive me more insane with every smile 😏🔥<br>
So tonight, I’m not raising a toast to your age…<br>
I’m raising it to the woman who keeps making my heart skip beats like it’s cardio. 🥂💋<br>
Wear that smile — and maybe nothing else later? 😉💌
